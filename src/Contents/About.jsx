              <p>
        I’m a 21-year-old developer passionate about crafting seamless, user-friendly experiences through thoughtful design and efficient code. I thrive at the intersection of frontend and backend development, ensuring applications are both aesthetically pleasing and smooth in performance.
<br /> <br />
Currently, I’m focused on growing my skills in React and Node.js. Through self-learning and personal projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience building responsive web applications with modern JavaScript frameworks. I love solving complex problems with elegant, user-focused solutions while maintaining high code quality.
<br /> <br />
Development is my creative outlet—it allows me to express my ideas and bring them to life. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, learning online, photography, and long cycle rides every weekend.
<br /> <br />

I’m always open to impactful collaborations and new challenges.
